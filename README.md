DirectoryWatcher
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/psenger/DirectoryWatcher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/psenger/DirectoryWatcher)

DirectoryWatcher is designed to watch a given directory, optionally recursively, for changes to the children files and then execute a defined command. This is very simlar to the github project [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) but is written in Java 1.7 and designed to execute one command.
